A tool for marketing analysis and decision making in paid media

Hi! My name is Bryan Ponce and I'm a marketer. Recently, I decided to learn Data Science and this is why I'm trying to automate the
dashboards I use for decision making and save time updating spreadsheets.

Also, I'm trying to create a tool that can make easier the budget allocation when we are activating a campaign, with the goal of maximizing
marketing results.

Project was created using:

Python
Pandas
Numpy
Matplotlib
Seaborne
Scikit-learn
XGBoost
Streamlit
